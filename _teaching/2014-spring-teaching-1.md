I taught this course at both the **undergraduate** and **master’s** levels every **Spring semester** at Istanbul Aydın University.

The course focused on core **bioinformatics algorithms** and the application of **R programming** for the analysis of biological data. Students developed pipelines to handle gene expression data and biomarker discovery projects.

**Course Level:**  
- Undergraduate (SEN 426)  
- Graduate (Bioinformatics for Master’s students)

**Years Taught:**  
- Spring 2019  
- Spring 2020  
- Spring 2021  
- Spring 2022  

**Topics Covered:**
- Sequence alignment algorithms (global/local: Needleman-Wunsch, Smith-Waterman)  
- **FASTA** and **BLAST** tools for sequence similarity searching  
- **Phylogenetic tree construction** (e.g., UPGMA, neighbor-joining)  
- **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)** for gene prediction and sequence modeling  
- Differential gene expression (microarray and RNA-Seq)  

**Tools & Languages:**  
- **R** (Bioconductor, limma, edgeR, ggplot2)
