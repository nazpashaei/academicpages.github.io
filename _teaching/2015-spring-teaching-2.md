This course was taught to both **undergraduate** (SEN 431) and **master’s** students across multiple Spring and Fall semesters.

It provided theoretical and practical knowledge on data mining techniques, covering both **classical methods** and **modern machine learning approaches** using **R** and **Python**.

**Course Level:**  
- Undergraduate: SEN 431 – Data Mining  
- Graduate: Data Mining for MSc in Artificial Intelligence 

**Years Taught:**  
- Fall 2019  
- Spring 2020  
- Fall 2020  
- Spring 2021  
- Spring 2022  

**Key Topics Covered:**
- Data preprocessing and feature selection  
- Classification algorithms (Decision Trees, SVM, k-NN, Naïve Bayes)  
- Clustering methods (k-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN)  
- Association rule mining (Apriori, FP-Growth)  
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE)  
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC)  
- Ensemble methods (Random Forest, Boosting)  
- Applications in biomedical datasets and text mining

**Tools & Languages Used:**
- **R** (`caret`, `randomForest`, `e1071`, `arules`)  
- Weka (for early-stage concepts and visualization)  
- Jupyter Notebook for practical assignments and reporting
