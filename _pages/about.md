## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Medical & Molecular Genetics at the Indiana University School of Medicine. My research focuses on computational biology and bioinformatics, with a strong emphasis on cancer biomarker discovery, gene selection, and the development of novel optimization-based machine learning methods. My work contributes to understanding tumorigenesis and metastasis by leveraging gene expression profiles, protein–protein interaction networks, and high-dimensional biomedical datasets.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from Yildiz Technical University in 2017, with a thesis focused on the meta-analysis of microRNAs and gene selection using machine learning techniques. I also hold an M.S. in Software Engineering from Qazvin Islamic Azad University, where I studied algorithmic applications in graph theory, and a B.S. in Computer Engineering.

### Research Interests

- Bioinformatics algorithms and cancer genomics  
- Feature selection and classification in high-dimensional biological data  
- Metaheuristic and swarm intelligence optimization methods  
- Biomedical image analysis and enhancement  
- Development of R packages for gene selection and analysis (e.g., DiCE, BHOA, PILC-BSCSO)

I have published extensively in high-impact journals such as *Nucleic Acids Research*, *Briefings in Bioinformatics*, *Expert Systems with Applications*, and *International Journal of Molecular Sciences*. I also serve on editorial boards and review for numerous scientific journals in bioinformatics and artificial intelligence.

In addition to research, I have taught undergraduate and graduate courses in machine learning, bioinformatics algorithms, optimization methods, and data mining. I have supervised multiple master's theses and am actively engaged in mentoring and academic service.
